# Reactjs-With-DjangoREST-FrameWork
I created this project based on the Home Tutor web application that aims to interact between teachers and students for better education.

Technical description: I developed this web application using the Django REST framework, ReactJS, and Material-UI. I have used the db.Sqlite3 Database which is Djangoâ€™s database set to SQLite by default.

Application Description: In this web application, there are two parts Admin-Credential and User-Credential.
Inside the admin credential, Admin can manage the complete Dashboard, Students list, Teachers list, Payment status, Website settings, OwnAccount, ChangePassword, and Login/Logout functions.
Inside the user credential User can access, OwnAccount, Change password, Download pdf, Payment-QR, Notice, etc.
Users can register and inquire with an inquiry form.
